# Gemini-API-Code
A Python script that starts up a chatbot with the Gemini Flash 2.0 LLM through the API.

The script is able to record chat history into a text file with date/time stamps.
The script also has a way to change the parameters used in language generation (top_k, top_p, etc.)
The script is set up such that the LLM is able to reference the chat history to make chat-specific responses.
